Lokahi Precision Care Portal

The Lokahi Precision Care Portal unifies patient care, monitoring, and billing by leveraging synthetic data, wearables, and agentic technology. This innovative solution delivers personalized insights and remote care management, with a specific focus on the breast cancer use case. The initiative aims to modernize medical insurance programs and provide seamless, patient-centered solutions by ensuring new technologies are fully integrated rather than treated as add-ons. Using Power B I we analyzed the Lokahi insurance database to facilitate this seamless integration, laying the foundation for a holistic approach to precision care.

The project emphasizes addressing challenges unique to breast cancer patients, such as cognitive conditions like "Chemo Brain." It incorporates several data streams—Wearable Data, Breast Cancer Data, and a comprehensive Treatment Model—to deliver tailored insights. These tools work in harmony with the Patient Talk feature, which enhances engagement by providing real-time, personalized guidance, fostering trust, and enabling timely interventions through an agentic Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). Together, these elements improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery.

By combining cutting-edge technology and accessibility, the Lokahi Precision Care Portal redefines healthcare with an integrated solution that unifies care and billing while alleviating the strain on Hawaii's medical system.
